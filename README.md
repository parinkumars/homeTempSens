# homeTempSens
 A temp sensor using esp32 and DHT11 that connects to blynk
 The esp8266 version of the code does not function, this project currently only supports the esp32.
 There will be a predictive weather thing which will be only supported by the esp32 board.
 Currently the esp32 also supports pressure and altitude along with temperature and humidity.
